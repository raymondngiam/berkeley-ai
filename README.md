Projects in UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to Artificial Intelligence (Spring 2014 version)

## Software Requirements

The Pac-Man projects are written in pure Python 2.7 and do not depend on any packages external to a standard Python distribution. 

## Table of Content

**P0: UNIX/Python Tutorial**
- This short UNIX/Python tutorial introduces students to the Python programming language and the UNIX environment.

**P1: Search**
- Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world. 

**P2: Multi-Agent Search**
- Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

**P3: Reinforcement Learning**
- Students implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot. 

**P4: Tracking**
- Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Students implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters. 

**P5: Classification**
- Students implement standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. Students extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.

**P6: Contest**
- Students create strategies for a team of two agents to play a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman.
